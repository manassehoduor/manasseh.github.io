I'm open to a wide range of fields related to data science. I can handle projects that involve data wrangling, data pre-processing, and data analysis in order to provide ultimate solutions. I studied Statistics and Programming, finished my Bachelor's degree in 2019. I have worked in both research and finance firms. I am currently freelancing remotely as a data scientist and tutoring on R.
